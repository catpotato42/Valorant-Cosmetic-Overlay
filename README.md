# Valorant Overlay
## Installation and Use (Windows PC only)
To the right of the files, click on the release, download, and extract the zip wherever is convenient. Run the VALORANT Overlay.exe file, and click on more info -> run anyway if a windows prompt pops up. After a couple seconds, the exe should run.
Once the program is running, you should be able to press fn+F2 or simply F2 depending on your keyboard to pull up the settings. There will be three boxes in the top left and an "exit" text box in the top right. Click and drag to move the boxes around, and press F2 again to save your changes. If you click and drag on the **bottom right** of the boxes, you should be able to resize them. To exit the program, you must click **directly on the text** of the exit button. If something in the program fails (it won't crash or cause an infinite loop, but might go behind other programs if they have higher admin privileges which would make the exit button unclickable), just press ctrl+alt+delete, go to task manager, and search Overlay or VALORANT and select "VALORANT Overlay" and click end task. 
After editing your settings, they should look something like this:
