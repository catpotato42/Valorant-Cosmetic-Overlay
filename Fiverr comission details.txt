animation should be given in a series of pngs, with the idle animations (one for each gun type) being approx. 200 by 200 px, and the jump pngs all having a uniform height of maybe triple that and the same width. animation is then achieved by moving the character up and down through the png. Idle animation only needs to be around 2 sec long, and the jump should be about the same. kill might be a little longer, whatever we decide on should be a sort of celebration by the character. importantly, the character should look like it's sitting on top of the gun, and colors should be non invasive. send screenshots of different parts of different valo maps holding a reaver vandal, a Neptune vandal, and a standard vandal, as well as 2 diff ss with a bandit and 2 with a knife.
